Starting the application should be straight forward:
1. Download the project as a ZIP file.
2. Unzip the project file and open it in NetBeans.
3. Click "Clean and build", then "Run".

Important:
The database must be populated manually. To do this, register a user on the web site and log in as that user.
Add a product by clicking "Publish product" on the front page (with all the products).
You can then visit this product's page to see all information about the seller (yourself) and the product.
If it's not your own product, you can leave a bid on it, or visit the seller's page to leave feedback on him/her.
You should therefore create an additional user (with its own product(s)) in order to leave a bid on the product or 
leave feedback on that user.

Feel free to message us if you have any questions or issues!
